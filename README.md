# palette_extraction (C#)

A simple implementation of Histogram and Median-Cut algorithms to extract a palette from an image. ðŸŒˆ

 - Histogram algorithm just splits the R,G,B space into n bins and assigns every color to a bin. All the colors in a bin are then averaged to produce a final color for the palette.
 - Median cut algorithm recursively splits the R,G,B space in bins of different sizes. All the colors in a bin are then averaged to produce a final color for the palette.
